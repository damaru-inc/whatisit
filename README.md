This is a pet project I'm working on to reaquaint myself with Java EE applications.

It's a way of tracking where my stuff is in my house.

For logging, I set up a jboss logging profile using the files in the scripts directory. I also added a few lines to pom.xml to set the logging profile in MANIFEST.MF.
